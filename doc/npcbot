NPCBot Commands
First of all, to list your NPCBot's stats, use /bonk on them (Warning: big list)

Note that some commands may not be available to all accounts (depending on their access level and permissions set in the RBAC tables (TC) / in the command table (AC)). You may need to change your account permissions / security level to enable usage of some commands Most NPCBot commands are divised by persmissions into two groups: player commands and GM commands, there are also some Admin-only commands

KEY:
< >  (angled brackets) indicates essential command argument  
[ ]  (square brackets) indicates optional command argument  
 |  (pipe character) indicates argument choices (i.e. this|that  = this OR that)  
_ARGUMENT_  indicates argument names
